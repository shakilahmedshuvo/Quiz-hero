                <h5>1.What is the difference between Map,Filter,forEach,Find?</h5>
                <!-- answer -->
                <p>Answer:Map is used to transform each element of an array and returns a new array with

                    the same number of
                    elements as the original array.
                    <br>
                    Filter is used to select a subset of elements from an array that meet a certain condition and
                    returns

                    a new array with only the selected elements.
                    <br>
                    forEach is used to iterate through each element of an array and execute a callback

                    function on each element. It does not return a new array.

                    Find is used to search through an array and return the first element that

                    meets a certain condition. If no element is found,

                    it returns undefined.

                <h5>2.What is the difference between Local Storage,Session Storage,cookies?</h5>
                <!-- answer -->
                <p>Local Storage: Local Storage is a way to store data in the browser with
                    no expiration date.

                    It is
                    persistent data that is available even after the browser
                    is closed and reopened.
                    Session Storage: Session Storage is similar to Local Storage, but the data is
                    only available for

                    the duration of the browser session.
                    <br>
                    Cookies: Cookies are small text files that are stored in the
                    browser by websites. They can be set to
                    expire after a certain period of time.

                <h5>3.What is Event Loop and how it works?</h5>
                <!-- answer -->
                <p>
                    The event loop is a fundamental concept in JavaScript that is responsible for
                    <br>
                    code in an efficient, non-blocking manner.
                    It's a mechanism that allows JavaScript to handle
                    asynchronous operations such as timers,
                    <br>
                    network
                
                    requests, and user input without blocking the main
                    execution
                    thread.
                    
                    
                    Here's how the event loop works:
                    
                    The JavaScript engine continuously runs the main thread,
                
                    which executes code synchronously.

                    When an asynchronous operation is initiated,
                
                    such as a timer or network request, it's added to a
                    queue of

                    pending tasks.
